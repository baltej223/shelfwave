There are some problems with it, 
- The book is getting added, but still there is error message being displayed on frontend, also even after adding bookm it is not shown on home page, handle it properly.
- The url of book [in jsonfile] has mismatch with the actual book saved location
- Make sure that, at the time of adding the book, if the user gives, url then handle it properly
